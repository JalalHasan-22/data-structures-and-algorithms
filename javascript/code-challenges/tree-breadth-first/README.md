# Tree Breadth First

In this challenge, I've implemented the Breadth First traversal method using a queue. I have recreated the Queue class with it is own Node class different than the tree class's node.

using the queue enqueue and dequeue methods, The implementation of Breadth First traversal was easily done using a simple while loop to check the front of the queue.

Below, you can find the whiteboard for the method.
