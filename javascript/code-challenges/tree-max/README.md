# Tree-max

in this code challenge, the goal was to write a function that finds the maximum value in a binary tree, I have implemented this functionality using two methods; the first method was to use any of the depth-first traverse methods which will return an array, then I used the map method on the resulting array to find the maximum value.
The second method was by traversing over all of the tree nodes using a while loop to find the maximum number, since this is not a binary search array; we have to travese over both left and right nodes.

## Big O Analysis

    <br>Big O: => time complexity => O(n) // we need to loop over all of the nodes.<br>

space => O(1) // the space of the new variable maxValue was used in the memory.
